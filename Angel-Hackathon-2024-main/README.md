Project Description
HEINEKEN Vietnam, one of the leading beer producers in Vietnam, aims to revolutionize the consumer brand experience. From retail stores to popular hangout spots, HEINEKEN's advertisements (banners, posters, LED signs, etc.) contribute to a captivating and unforgettable experience for customers. However, checking and evaluating these placements currently consumes significant time and cost. Our project proposes an automated image analysis tool to address this issue.

Objectives
Develop an image analysis tool capable of automatically detecting and evaluating the following elements in real-world settings:

Brand Logos: Detect logos of Heineken, Tiger, Bia Viet, Larue, Bivina, Edelweiss, and Strongbow.
Products: Identify beer crates and bottles.
Consumers: Assess the number, activities, and emotions of customers.
Advertisements: Recognize posters, banners, and other brand advertisements.
Image Context: Analyze the settingâ€”restaurants, bars, grocery stores, supermarkets, etc.
Business Problems Addressed
We focus on the following business problems to maximize our chances of success:

Counting Beer Drinkers:

Use YOLOWORD technology to count the number of attendees at events, bars, or restaurants, identifying the number of consumers of HEINEKEN products.

Evaluating Customer Experience at Events:

Analyze facial expressions at events to assess their satisfaction and experience.
